4. Schedule:
   - Estimated Duration: 2 days
   - Day 1: Unit and integration testing
   - Day 2: Security and session tests

5. Handling Failed Tests:
   - All failed or inconclusive test cases will be logged in the bug tracking system
   - Issues will be reassigned to developers for fixes
   - Re-tests will be conducted after the fix is deployed

Test Plan 2 – Database & Data Integrity

1. Components to be Tested:
   - Database connection (MySQL)
   - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Data validation and foreign key constraints
   - Backup and recovery mechanism

2. Testing Approach:
   - Unit tests for SQL queries
   - Integration tests for CRUD functionality
   - Data consistency checks across related tables
   - Stress test with bulk data operations

3. Roles and Responsibilities:
   - Nimesh Neupane – Primary database tester
   - Sandip Khatri – Support for CRUD and constraint testing

4. Schedule:
   - Estimated Duration: 3 days
   - Day 1: Connection and data validation testing
   - Day 2: CRUD operations and constraints
   - Day 3: Backup/recovery and stress testing

5. Handling Failed Tests:
   - Failed operations will be logged with SQL error details
   - Rollback strategies will be implemented if corruption occurs
   - Issues will be corrected and re-tested with clean data


Test Plan 3 – Frontend & UI/UX Responsiveness

1. Components to be Tested:
   - Navigation bar across all pages
   - Forms and interactive buttons
   - Responsiveness on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
   - Accessibility compliance (contrast, alt text, ARIA labels)

2. Testing Approach:
   - Manual testing for navigation flow
   - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
   - Responsive design testing with device simulators
   - Accessibility audit with automated tools

3. Roles and Responsibilities:
   - Ashutosh Mishra – Lead tester for UI and responsiveness
   - Saddam Safi – Assist with accessibility and mobile checks

4. Schedule:
   - Estimated Duration: 2 days
   - Day 1: UI functionality and form validation
   - Day 2: Responsiveness and accessibility testing

5. Handling Failed Tests:
   - Screenshots will be captured for all UI bugs
   - Issues will be reported to frontend developer
   - Fixes verified through re-testing on affected devices

Test Plan 4 – Integration & System Performance

1. Components to be Tested:
   - API communication between frontend and backend
   - End-to-end system workflows (user signup to final output)
   - System load and performance under heavy usage
   - Error handling during failures

2. Testing Approach:
   - Integration testing for API endpoints (status codes, responses)
   - End-to-end scenarios covering full user journeys
   - Load testing with 50+ simulated users
   - Stress test to identify bottlenecks

3. Roles and Responsibilities:
   - Sandip Khatri – Lead integration tester
   - Nimesh Neupane – Assist with load and performance testing

4. Schedule:
   - Estimated Duration: 4 days
   - Day 1: API integration testing
   - Day 2: End-to-end workflow testing
   - Day 3: Load testing with simulated users
   - Day 4: Stress and failure recovery testing

5. Handling Failed Tests:
   - Errors and performance issues logged in monitoring system
   - Escalated to dev team for optimization
   - Stress tests rerun to validate fixes
